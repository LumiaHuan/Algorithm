# Algorithm
This is my algorithm's home

## Binary Search

1. recursive
2. non-recursive


## Bag, Queue, Stack

1. Bag: calculate mean and std
2. Bag (implemented by link list)
3. Queue(implemented by link list)
   * ReverseQueue(by a stack)
4. Stack(implemented by Array): 
   * Reverse input 
   * Dijkstra’s Two-Stack Algorithm for Expression Evaluation
   * FixedCapacityStackOfStrings(avoid loitering)
   * FixedCapacityStack, generic stack(avoid loitering)
     * add peek()
   * ResizedCapacityStack, foreach operation
     * add peek()
5. Stack(implemented by link list):
   * Parentheses: uses a stack to determine whether string's parentheses are properly balanced.
   * Prints the binary representation of number N 
   * add peek()
   * InfixToPostfix:converts an arithmetic expression from in- ﬁx to postﬁx.
